To add custom files to a FreeBSD installation using `mtree`, you can modify the mtree specification
files that define the directory hierarchy and file permissions. `mtree` is a utility that reads a
specification file and applies it to the filesystem, creating directories, setting permissions, and
managing files.

### Overview

1. **Mtree Specification Files**: These files describe the structure and permissions of directories and
files.
2. **Updating Mtree Specifications**: You can modify these specifications to include custom files and
directories in your FreeBSD build.

### Steps to Add Custom Files Using Mtree

#### 1. **Locate the Mtree Specification Files**

Mtree specification files are usually found in the FreeBSD source tree under `src/etc/mtree/`. Key
specification files include:

- `BSD.root.dist`: Specifies the root filesystem layout.
- `BSD.var.dist`: Specifies the `/var` filesystem layout.
- `BSD.usr.dist`: Specifies the `/usr` filesystem layout.

#### 2. **Modify the Appropriate Mtree File**

To add custom files, you need to edit the appropriate mtree specification file. For example, to add a
custom file under `/etc/`, you would modify `BSD.root.dist`.

#### Example: Adding a Custom Script to `/etc/rc.d/`

**Step A: Define the Custom File in `BSD.root.dist`**

1. **Open `BSD.root.dist`**:

 ```sh
 cd /home/python/Documents/freebsd/src/etc/mtree/
 vi BSD.root.dist
 ```

2. **Add Entry for Custom Script**:

 Locate the section for `/etc/rc.d/` and add an entry for your custom script. For example:

 ```
 /etc/rc.d/firstboot     type=file mode=0755 uname=root gname=wheel
 ```

 This entry specifies that a file named `firstboot` should be placed in `/etc/rc.d/` with mode `0755` and
owned by `root:wheel`.
**Step B: Provide the Custom Script**

Ensure that your custom script (`firstboot`) is placed in the appropriate location in the source tree so
that it gets included during the installation process.

1. **Place the Script**:

 ```sh
 cp /path/to/your/firstboot /home/python/Documents/freebsd/src/etc/rc.d/firstboot
 ```

2. **Set Permissions**:

 Make sure the script has the correct permissions:

 ```sh
 chmod 755 /home/python/Documents/freebsd/src/etc/rc.d/firstboot
 ```

#### 3. **Rebuild the System**

After modifying the mtree file and ensuring that the custom files are in place, rebuild the FreeBSD
system. During the installation phase, the `mtree` specifications will be applied, and the custom files
will be installed accordingly.

**Example Build Commands**:

```sh
cd /home/python/Documents/freebsd/src
make buildworld
make installworld DESTDIR=/path/to/installation/directory
```

Ensure you specify the correct `DESTDIR` if you're installing into a chroot environment or a custom
installation directory.

### Important Considerations

1. **File Permissions and Ownership**: Carefully set the permissions and ownership for any new files
or directories you add. Incorrect settings can lead to security issues or operational failures.

2. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the resulting system to ensure that all customizations are correctly
applied and that the system behaves as expected.

3. **Documentation**: Document any changes made to mtree specifications and the source tree to
maintain clarity and reproducibility.

### Conclusion
By modifying the mtree specification files and ensuring that your custom files are included in the
source tree, you can effectively customize the layout and contents of a FreeBSD installation. This
method provides a structured way to manage filesystem hierarchy and permissions during the system
build process.

So can I use release.sh with this?


Attempt

add rc.d firstboot tags=package=custom to mtree bsd.root.dist

mkdir -p /home/python/Documents/freebsd/src/etc/rc.d

  pkg bootstrap -f

  # Update the package repository

next example: Create a Firstboot Script
sh
Copy code
cat <<EOF >> /mnt/etc/rc.d/firstboot
env ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES=YES pkg bootstrap
pkg install -y mc
EOF

This block of code does the following:
    • cat <<EOF >> /mnt/etc/rc.d/firstboot: This line begins a "heredoc" (here
      document) that appends the following lines until EOF into the file
      /mnt/etc/rc.d/firstboot. The >> operator appends to the file if it exists, or creates it
      if it doesn't.
    • env ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES=YES pkg bootstrap: This command initializes the
      FreeBSD package manager (pkg). The ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES=YES environment variable
      setting ensures that pkg does not prompt for confirmation, making it suitable for automated
      scripts.
    • pkg install -y mc: This command installs the Midnight Commander (mc) package. The
      -y flag automatically answers "yes" to any prompts, again making the script suitable for
      automation.


chmod 755 /home/python/Documents/freebsd/src/etc/rc.d/firstboot



to cleanup

rm -rf /scratch/*
